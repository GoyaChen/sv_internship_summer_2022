## Morning (John has a meeting)

* Pick up where we left off
	* Using Postman, reproduce all the queries in the [API documentation](https://github.com/rice-crc/voyages-api)
* API server has been updated per [merge 32](https://github.com/rice-crc/voyages-api/pull/32/commits/483b5983760bb94836be44c96403287d05ceabe9)
* So begin with the remote server
* If the server fails
	* Log your error
	* Switch to your local docker build and inspect the errors in the terminal for better logging
* Then run it these again but in Python, using the [requests package](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Late morning/afternoon

* Move on to [Nishant's Notebooks](https://github.com/nishantsatpathy/voyages_python_notebooks)
* Reproduce those options/post requests workflows

## Late afternoon

* Move on to [John's Plotly apps](https://github.com/JohnMulligan/voyages_plotly_2022)
