## day header notes

* The team (I believe it was Alison's win) got Xinna's app up and running
* And dove into using her react components and others
	* to see what would work best
	* with an eye towards CI/CD pipelines

## findings

* Minghao
	* Differing opinions on which packages/libraries to use
	* Learning React from scratch
	* Experimented with a MUI [rc-slider component](https://slider-react-component.vercel.app/)
* Alison
	* Alison would like to make a case for using Material UI
	* [Fixed the login on Xinna's app and is going to open a PR](https://github.com/XinnaPan/Slave_Voyage/pull/1)
	* Made some progress on autocomplete -- but stuck on it and would like to talk to Xinna
	* And Alison poses another challenge/question:
		* Should this be built using classes or functions?
		* Alison's vote is for functions
* Haoyu
	* Also took on autocomplete
	* Decided to build one from scratch to better understand how it could work -- [repo](https://github.com/haoyuf1/Autocomplete-App)
* Jiasheng
	* Looked into documentation to understand requests better
		* [uva](https://github.com/dvajs/dva)
		* [umi](https://umijs.org/)
	* Dug into the options calls & tree components
	* And [ant](https://ant.design/) components
* Gaoyuan
	* Worked with material ui sliders and [got a demo working](https://intense-sands-51962.herokuapp.com/)
	* But ran into CORS issues and got stuck
* Lize
	* Looked into react tables
		* [ant table](https://ant.design/components/table/)
		* [react-table](https://react-table-v7.tanstack.com/)
	* Thinks we need to prioritize framework
	* [John's specs for a table](https://github.com/JohnMulligan/voyages-api/blob/main/tablerequirements.md)
	* Lize makes a case for using Bootstrap
* Zhihao and Jiran
	* Worked on rangesliders from scratch and got one working
	* Want to circle back to Xinna's code next to understand it better
	* [MUI slider](https://mui.com/zh/material-ui/react-slider/)
* Zewen
	* Worked on the tree component and wants to style it next (link to come)
* Jiacheng
	* Worked on making requests
	* But these have been failing
	* Tried out
		* React + fetch
		* React + axios
